## Qubits, Superposition and Entanglement

A qubit is the basic unit of information in quantum computing. Qubits play a similar role in quantum computing as bits play in classical computing, but they behave very differently. Classical bits are binary and can hold only a position of 0 or 1, but qubits can hold a superposition of all possible states. This means that a qubit can be in a state of 0, 1, or any quantum superposition of the two. There are infinite possible superpositions of 0 and 1, and each of them is a valid qubit state. For eg., in a classical computing system, using 8 bits you can encode 256 different values, only one value at a time. But with 8 qubits, you could encode 256 values at the same time!

Superposition states enable the power of quantum computing. A quantum particle such as an electron has its own “facing left or facing right” property, namely spin, referred to as either up or down, so the quantum state of an electron is a superposition of "spin up" and "spin down"

Entanglement is the correlation between two or mroe quantum systems. When two qubits are said to be "entangled", they're correlated and sharing the information of their states such that the quantum state of individual qubits can't be described indipendently. With quantum entanglement you can only know the quantum state of the global system, not the individual states. Entangled quantum systems maintain this correlation even when separated over large distances. This means that whatever operation or process you apply to one subsystem correlates to the other subsystem as well. Thus, measuring the state of one qubit provides information about the state of the other qubit
